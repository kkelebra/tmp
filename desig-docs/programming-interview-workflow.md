### **1. Overview**
This document outlines the design and workflow for conducting programming interviews that involve asking technical questions, evaluating responses, and assessing candidates' problem-solving skills. The process is designed to be efficient, structured, and fair, ensuring a consistent experience for both interviewers and candidates.

---

### **2. Objectives**
- Evaluate candidates' technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and coding proficiency.
- Provide a structured format for interviewers to ask questions and assess responses.
- Ensure a fair and consistent evaluation process across all candidates.

---

### **3. Workflow**
The programming interview is divided into the following stages:

#### **3.1 Pre-Interview Preparation**
1. **Define the Role Requirements**:
   - Identify the technical skills and knowledge required for the role (e.g., algorithms, data structures, system design, etc.).
   - Create a list of topics and questions relevant to the role.

2. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Use an online coding platform (e.g., HackerRank, LeetCode, CodeSignal) or a shared IDE (e.g., CoderPad, CodeInterview).
   - Ensure the platform supports real-time collaboration and code execution.

3. **Select Questions**:
   - Choose a mix of easy, medium, and hard questions.
   - Include a variety of question types:
     - Coding challenges (e.g., implement a function, solve a problem).
     - Conceptual questions (e.g., explain a concept, discuss trade-offs).
     - Debugging tasks (e.g., fix a broken piece of code).

---

#### **3.2 Interview Workflow**
1. **Introduction (5-10 minutes)**:
   - Greet the candidate and introduce the interviewers.
   - Provide an overview of the interview structure.
   - Set expectations (e.g., "We are looking for clean, efficient code and clear communication.").

2. **Warm-Up Question (5-10 minutes)**:
   - Start with an easy question to help the candidate feel comfortable.
   - Example: "Write a function to reverse a string."

3. **Main Questions (30-40 minutes)**:
   - Present 2-3 technical questions of increasing difficulty.
   - Allow the candidate to ask clarifying questions.
   - Evaluate the following:
     - Problem-solving approach.
     - Code correctness and efficiency.
     - Communication and thought process.

4. **Follow-Up Questions (Optional)**:
   - Ask follow-up questions to explore edge cases or alternative solutions.
   - Example: "How would your solution handle very large inputs?"

5. **Behavioral Questions (5-10 minutes)**:
   - Ask questions to assess teamwork, communication, and adaptability.
   - Example: "Tell me about a time you faced a challenging bug. How did you resolve it?"

6. **Q&A (5 minutes)**:
   - Allow the candidate to ask questions about the role, team, or company.

#### **3.3 Post-Interview Evaluation**
1. **Scoring Criteria**:
   - Use a standardized rubric to evaluate candidates on:
     - Problem-solving skills.
     - Code quality (readability, maintainability, efficiency).
     - Communication and collaboration.
     - Cultural fit (optional).

2. **Feedback**:
   - Provide constructive feedback to the candidate, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.

3. **Decision**:
   - Discuss the candidate's performance with the interview panel.
   - Decide whether to move the candidate to the next stage or reject.

### **4. Key Components**
#### **4.1 Question Design**
- Ensure questions are clear, unambiguous, and relevant to the role.
- Include edge cases and constraints to test the candidate's thoroughness.

#### **4.2 Real-Time Collaboration**
- Use tools that allow candidates to write and execute code in real-time.
- Provide hints or guidance if the candidate gets stuck (optional).

#### **4.3 Evaluation Rubric**
| **Criteria**         | **Weight** | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Problem-Solving       | 40%        | Ability to break down the problem and devise a solution.                        |
| Code Quality          | 30%        | Readability, maintainability, and efficiency of the code.                       |
| Communication         | 20%        | Clarity in explaining the thought process and asking questions.                 |
| Cultural Fit (Optional)| 10%       | Alignment with company values and ability to work in a team.                    |

### **5. Tools and Platforms**
- **Coding Platforms**: HackerRank, LeetCode, CodeSignal, CoderPad.
- **Video Conferencing**: Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams.
- **Shared IDEs**: Visual Studio Code Live Share, CodeInterview.

---

### **6. Best Practices**
1. **Be Candidate-Friendly**:
   - Create a welcoming environment.
   - Avoid overly tricky or irrelevant questions.

2. **Encourage Communication**:
   - Ask the candidate to explain their thought process.
   - Provide hints if they are stuck for too long.

3. **Focus on Problem-Solving**:
   - Prioritize how the candidate approaches the problem over getting the exact solution.

4. **Document Everything**:
   - Take notes during the interview to provide detailed feedback later.

---

### **7. Example Questions**
#### **Easy**:
- Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.

#### **Medium**:
- Implement a function to find the longest substring without repeating characters.

#### **Hard**:
- Design a system to handle real-time chat messages with high availability.
